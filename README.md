# G2 ✌️

> An experimental component system.

The project is a from-scratch reimagining of `@wordpress/components` to accommodate the ever-growing and ever-expressive needs of the Editor and the platform. The ultimate goal is to provide a first class workflow to empower developers and designers (both core and 3rd party) to create cohesive, robust, and delightful user interfaces.

These components (and their sub-systems) have been uniquely developed to meet the need of integrating seamless into Gutenberg and WordPress. The UI's native-like aesthetic also allows them to be easily customized used outside of the Editor - potentially for 3rd party WordPress plugins and beyond!
