# Text

`Text` is a core component that renders text in the library, using the library's typography system.

## Usage

`Text` can be used to render any text-content, like an HTML `p` or `span`.

```jsx live
import { Text } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return <Text>Where the north wind meets the sea</Text>
}
```

### align

| Value  | Description                |
| ------ | -------------------------- |
| left   | Aligns text to the left.   |
| center | Aligns text to the center. |
| right  | Aligns text to the right.  |

```jsx live
import { Text } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return (
    <Text align="center" isBlock>
      Where the north wind meets the sea...
    </Text>
  )
}
```

### highlightWords

Letters or words within `Text` can be highlighted using `highlightWords`.

```jsx live
import { Text } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return (
    <Text highlightWords={["the"]}>
      Where the north wind meets the sea, there's a river full of memory. Sleep,
      my darling, safe and sound, for in this river all is found. In her waters,
      deep and true, lay the answers and a path for you. Dive down deep into her
      sound, but not too far or you'll be drowned
    </Text>
  )
}
```

### optimizeReadabilityFor

The `Text` color can be adapted to a background color for optimal readability. `optimizeReadabilityFor` can accept CSS variables, in addition to standard CSS color values (e.g. Hex, RGB, HSL, etc...).

```jsx live
import { Text, View } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  const backgroundColor = "blue"

  return (
    <View css={{ backgroundColor }}>
      <Text optimizeReadabilityFor={backgroundColor}>
        Where the north wind meets the sea, there's a river full of memory.
        Sleep, my darling, safe and sound, for in this river all is found. In
        her waters, deep and true, lay the answers and a path for you. Dive down
        deep into her sound, but not too far or you'll be drowned
      </Text>
    </View>
  )
}
```

### size

`Text` can render a wide range of font sizes, which are automatically calculated and adapted to the typography system. The `size` value can be a system preset, a `number`, or a custom unit value (`string`) such as `30em`.

#### Preset

| Value       | Description                               |
| ----------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| largeTitle  | Renders an effective font-size of `28px`. |
| title       | Renders an effective font-size of `20px`. |
| body        | Renders an effective font-size of `13px`. |
| subheadline | Renders an effective font-size of `12px`. |
| footnote    | Renders an effective font-size of `11px`. |
| caption     | Renders an effective font-size of `10px`. |

```jsx live
import { Text } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return <Text size="largeTitle">Where the north wind meets the sea...</Text>
}
```

#### Custom

```jsx live
import { Text } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return <Text size={20}>Where the north wind meets the sea...</Text>
}
```

### truncate

When `truncate` is set,we are able to truncate the long text in a variety of ways.

```jsx live
import { Text } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return (
    <Text truncate>
      Where the north wind meets the sea, there's a river full of memory. Sleep,
      my darling, safe and sound, for in this river all is found. In her waters,
      deep and true, lay the answers and a path for you. Dive down deep into her
      sound, but not too far or you'll be drowned
    </Text>
  )
}
```

#### ellipsizeMode

For example, we can truncate text right in the middle. To do this, we need to set `ellipsizeMode` to `middle` and a text `limit`. For more information about truncation, check out [`Truncate`](/components/truncate).

```jsx live
import { Text } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return (
    <Text truncate ellipsizeMode="middle" limit={40}>
      Where the north wind meets the sea, there's a river full of memory. Sleep,
      my darling, safe and sound, for in this river all is found. In her waters,
      deep and true, lay the answers and a path for you. Dive down deep into her
      sound, but not too far or you'll be drowned
    </Text>
  )
}
```

### variant

| Value | Description         |
| ----- | ------------------- |
| muted | Renders muted text. |

```jsx live
import { Text } from "@wp-g2/components"

function Example() {
  return <Text variant="muted">Where the north wind meets the sea...</Text>
}
```
