### Truncation

When `truncate` is set,we are able to truncate the long text in a variety of ways.

```jsx live
<Text truncate>
  Where the north wind meets the sea, there's a river full of memory. Sleep, my
  darling, safe and sound, for in this river all is found. In her waters, deep
  and true, lay the answers and a path for you. Dive down deep into her sound,
  but not too far or you'll be drowned
</Text>
```

#### ellipsizeMode

For example, we can truncate text right in the middle. To do this, we need to set `ellipsizeMode` to `middle` and a text `limit`.

```jsx live
<Text truncate ellipsizeMode="middle" limit={40}>
  Where the north wind meets the sea, there's a river full of memory. Sleep, my
  darling, safe and sound, for in this river all is found. In her waters, deep
  and true, lay the answers and a path for you. Dive down deep into her sound,
  but not too far or you'll be drowned
</Text>
```
