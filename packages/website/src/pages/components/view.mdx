# View

`View` is the foundational element that renders component in the library. It is the principle component in the entire library.

A `View` is **everything**.
Everything is a `View`.

## Usage

```jsx live
<View>
  <Text>Into the unknown</Text>
</View>
```

### Props

There are two primary but foundational props for a `View`.

| Name | Type              | Default | Description                                             |
| ---- | ----------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| as   | `string`          | `div`   | Render as any HTML element or (custom) React component. |
| css  | `Object`,`string` |         | Render CSS using the Style system.                      |

#### as

The `as` property is an important concept for a `View`. It is a powerful property that allows a `View` to render as **anything**.

```jsx live
<View as="ul">
  <View as="li">
    <Text>Into the unknown</Text>
  </View>
</View>
```

#### css

The `css` property allows for the `View` to performantly and reliably render any CSS styles using the libraries System system.

##### string

If you prefer a more "traditional" CSS-like workflow, you can pass a `string` into the `css` prop. The Style system supports Sass-like workflows, for example using `&` for nesting.

```jsx live
<View
  css={`
    background: dodgerblue;
    &:hover {
      background: yellow;
    }
  `}
>
  <Text>Into the unknown</Text>
</View>
```

##### Object

Another way to pass in styles is using a style Object.

```jsx live
<View
  css={{
    background: "dodgerblue",
    "&:hover": {
      background: "yellow",
    },
  }}
>
  <Text>Into the unknown</Text>
</View>
```

### Styling with Presets

The Style system provides a bunch of style presets, which come from `@wp-g2/styles`. These presets are namespaced under `ui`.

```jsx
import { ui } from "@wp-g2/styles"
```

Presets can style a `View` by passing an `Array` of them into the `css` prop.

```jsx live
<View
  css={[
    ui.padding(5),
    ui.background.blue,
    ui.hover(ui.background.red, ui.scale(1.02)),
    ui.active(ui.background.yellow, ui.scale(0.8)),
    ui.animation.bounce,
  ]}
>
  <Text>Into the unknown</Text>
</View>
```
