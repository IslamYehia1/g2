# Spacer

`Spacer` is a primitive layout component that providers inner (`padding`) or outer (`margin`) space in-between components. It can also be used to adaptively provide space within an [`HStack`](./hstack) or [`VStack`](./vstack).

### Usage

```jsx live
<View>
  <Spacer>
    <Heading>Into the unknown</Heading>
  </Spacer>
  <Text>
    Every day's a little harder as I feel your power grow. Don't you know
    there's part of me that longs to go.
  </Text>
</View>
```

### Props

`Spacer` comes with a bunch of shorthand props to adjust `margin` and `padding`. The values of these props work as a multiplier to the library's grid system (base of `4px`).

| Name | Type     | Default | Description             |
| ---- | -------- | ------- | ----------------------- |
| m    | `number` |         | Adjusts all margins.    |
| mt   | `number` |         | Adjusts top margins.    |
| mb   | `number` | `2`     | Adjusts bottom margins. |
| ml   | `number` |         | Adjusts left margins.   |
| mr   | `number` |         | Adjusts right margins.  |
| p    | `number` |         | Adjusts all padding.    |
| pt   | `number` |         | Adjusts top padding.    |
| pb   | `number` |         | Adjusts bottom padding. |
| pl   | `number` |         | Adjusts left padding.   |
| pr   | `number` |         | Adjusts right padding.  |
